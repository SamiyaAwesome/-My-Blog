    <p class="text-muted" >Los Angeles not only has many names, but also offers an incredible wealth of places worth seeing. Whether Hollywood, Sunset Strip or Venice Beach  the metropolis on the US West Coast impresses with world-famous places of longing.
      Once you've been there, you won't soon forget the movie capital, its glitz and glamour. The fascinating thing about the second largest city in the USA is its diversity and vastness.

In this heartwarming movie, based on a true story, friendship and creativity save the day in more ways than one. You can catch it now streaming on Disney plus!

      The Bad Guys is a stylish and sleek turn for DreamWorks Animation. Predictable on the surface but it had a few unexpected twists 
      that shook it up a bit and its message about doing good deeds — though overly familiar — means well and is decently executed.
      The characters are perfectly cast; Sam Rockwell carries the story with slick charm and a surprise helping of emotional depth.
      The humor hits more times than not. That said, when it does miss — usually with the occasional juvenile gags that's par for the DreamWorks course — it can fall pretty flat.
      Whenever that happens, though, the film does manage strong comebacks, be it a moving character-driven moment, a legitimately funny bit, or a dazzling sequence owing to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
      The Bad Guys is a totally serviceable family film.
      Tons of fun visual splendor for the younglings and a fast-paced, artful heist-film vibe for older audiences to admire.

    <p>
      Enola Homes is a fun watch. It's light-hearted and breezy and charming and delightful. 
      It's many things and much credit goes to the director Harry Bradbeer for bringing this story in this manner and more importantly to Millie Bobby Brown who is just fantastic in the role of Enola. 
      She is so charming and endlessly watchable. If not for her, I don't think this film would have felt as energetic and fresh as it turned out to be. 
      She does everything with such ease and so effortlessly. The supporting cast is also a very good bunch of actors.
       Henry Cavill, Sam Claflin, Helena Bonham Carter and Louis Partridge play all of their parts sincerely.
